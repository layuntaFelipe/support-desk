Apple Support Desk was one of my most challenging projects yet, that's because it was the first project where I worked on the front and back end of a project, working on my database, and on my own API. Having to learn new technologies, but in the end, every new knowledge learned was worth it, because, in the end, I had built a real-world MERN full stack project that worked perfectly.

Apple Support Desk is a MERN app mainly focused on the backend side of a project. It consists of simple actions of a customer can register and login into my MongoDB database, then it can create a ticket informing which devices are not working correctly, and describe what is the problem.

The user can check out his ticket and send messages to the staff about the ticket as well, and once the problem is solved, the user can close the ticket.

This project was great for me to learn more about NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, and Redux, build a backend, and work with libraries I've never worked with, like BCrypt, and Jsonwebtoken.
